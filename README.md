# ProductSelector 

# üèó Setup
There are no dependencies as well as any package managers involved. 
The project has more like a demo app setup e.g simply grab what you need for your needs. 
the layout is wrapped into a separate `UIViewController` type for convenience (I could've create a separate layout factory and have just a single view controller, however, for the sake of simplicity I decided to make it possible to extract layout with all the dependent code).

# ‚úàÔ∏è Usage
Simply grab a `UIViewController` type with a custom layout and adjust it for your needs. The layout is in [here](https://alm-github.systems.uk.hsbc/45055467/ProductSelector/tree/master/ProductSelector/Layout).
Everything else in this Demo app is just me playing around with a few things
